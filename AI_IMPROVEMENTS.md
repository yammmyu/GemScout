# AI Job Extraction Improvements

## ðŸš€ Major Enhancements Made

### âœ… **Enhanced Content Extraction**
- **Structured Job Card Detection**: Added `extractJobCards()` function that specifically targets job listing HTML structures
- **Site-Specific Selectors**: Handles Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and generic job sites
- **Smart Link Extraction**: Extracts actual job posting URLs instead of generic page links
- **Salary Detection**: Captures salary information when available
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoids duplicate jobs based on title + company matching

### âœ… **Improved AI Prompt**
- **More Context**: Provides 3000 chars of text instead of 2000
- **Structured Data Input**: Feeds pre-extracted job card data to AI
- **Better Instructions**: Clear guidelines to extract 10-20+ jobs instead of just a few
- **Specific Link Requirements**: Instructs AI to use individual job URLs, not page URLs
- **Enhanced Output Format**: Includes salary field and better descriptions

### âœ… **Better Data Quality**
- **Page Metadata**: Includes page title and meta description for context
- **Job-Related Links**: Filters and provides only job-relevant links to AI
- **Comprehensive Extraction**: Targets up to 20 jobs per page instead of limiting to 4
- **Detailed Job Cards**: Pre-extracts structured data that AI can refine and enhance

### âœ… **UI Improvements**
- **Salary Display**: Shows salary information in green badges when available
- **Better Layout**: Improved spacing and presentation of job information

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### **Job Card Selectors Added**
```javascript
// Indeed
'[data-jk]', '.job_seen_beacon', '.slider_container .slider_item'

// LinkedIn  
'.job-card-container', '.job-search-card'

// Glassdoor
'.react-job-listing', '.jobContainer'

// Generic
'.job-card', '.job-item', '.job-listing'
```

### **Enhanced Data Structure**
```typescript
interface JobPosting {
  title: string
  company: string  
  location: string
  link: string      // Now extracts specific job URLs
  description: string
  salary?: string   // New optional field
}
```

### **Improved AI Context**
- **Pre-structured data**: AI gets clean job card objects to work with
- **Filtered links**: Only job-relevant links provided
- **More text context**: 3000 chars instead of 2000
- **Clear extraction goals**: "Extract ALL jobs, aim for 10-20+"

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Improvements**

### **Expected Results After Update:**
1. **More Jobs Found**: Should find 10-20+ jobs instead of just 4
2. **Better Links**: Each job should have its own specific URL
3. **Accurate Data**: Company names, locations, and titles should be more precise
4. **Salary Info**: Will show salary ranges when available on the page
5. **Better Descriptions**: More detailed and relevant job descriptions

### **Test Steps:**
1. **Reload extension** in Chrome Extensions page
2. **Visit Indeed job search** (like Singapore engineer jobs)
3. **Click "Scan Current Page"**
4. **Check console** for enhanced extraction logs:
   ```
   DOM snapshot collected: { jobCardsCount: 15 }
   **STRUCTURED JOB DATA FOUND (15 job cards detected):**
   ```
5. **Open popup** to see more jobs with better data quality

### **Console Output to Monitor:**
```
DOM snapshot collected: { 
  url: "...", 
  textLength: 9664, 
  linksCount: 87,
  jobCardsCount: 15  // <-- New field showing structured data found
}

**STRUCTURED JOB DATA FOUND (15 job cards detected):**
[{
  "title": "Senior Staff Engineer - GaN Epitaxy",
  "company": "Infineon Technologies", 
  "location": "Singapore",
  "link": "https://sg.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=abc123...",  // <-- Specific job URL
  "description": "...",
  "salary": "$8,000 - $12,000"  // <-- Salary if available
}]
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solutions**

### âœ… **Fixed: Limited to 4 Jobs**
- New extraction targets 20+ job cards per page
- AI instructed to extract ALL available jobs
- Better site-specific selectors find more job listings

### âœ… **Fixed: Poor Link Quality** 
- Pre-extracts actual job posting URLs from job cards
- Provides specific job links to AI instead of generic page URL
- Validates and converts relative URLs to absolute URLs

### âœ… **Fixed: Inconsistent Information**
- Structured extraction provides clean, consistent data
- Site-specific selectors target the right elements
- AI gets pre-processed data to refine rather than raw text to parse

### âœ… **Added: Salary Information**
- Detects and extracts salary/compensation data
- Displays in popup with green styling
- Optional field that appears when available

The extension should now provide much more comprehensive and accurate job extraction with the real AI! ðŸš€
